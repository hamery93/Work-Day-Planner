Stay Organized: A Simple Work Day Scheduler 

During this project I created a simple and easy to use work day scheduler that saves the data into local storage. The app highlights the current time block in red, future blocks in green,
and past blocks in gray. Typing out a note in the textbox and hitting the save icon on the right will save your data into the browser's local storage for easy access later on. 
This gives the app increased functionality and allows the user to focus on their daily events without worrying about losing data.
